## Music Recommender System

Project completed as part of the ADBI 591 course at NCSU.

Created a recommender system that will recommend new musical artists to a user based on their listening history. Suggesting different songs or musical artists to a user is important to many music streaming services, such as Pandora and Spotify. In addition, this type of recommender system could also be used as a means of suggesting TV shows or movies to a user (e.g., Netflix).

Completed using Apache Spark, Python and the Collaborative filtering technique.
